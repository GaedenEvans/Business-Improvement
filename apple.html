The card is made of The card is made of titanium, doesn't have any numbers on it, and is more of a tech accessory to the company's Apple Pay wireless payments system than a standalone credit card. This may be good if you know a lot about banking or if you are a big guy on technology. Apple is also a very popular copmany especially amongust millenials because having an apple phone is what makes you cool because they are quite expensive just a little more than a samsung phone.

Apple is a compant that like to stay up to date on its tech and tends to add something new to their company every year or so. Apple has made many phones and has made ipads,macbooks,and airpods all devices are quite popular especially airpods because when they hit the market it was something new for the oummunity and something that was different from the rest of the bluetooth headphones because they were bluetooth earbuds and if you had one of their apple phones it was easier to connect your apple airpods rather than having a samsung or another android.  Apple tends to release a device and have it become widely popular because of their name the apple airpods are a great example of that because after the airpods many devices tried to replicate airpods.  In  conclusion Apple is a very popular company that has built their name to where if they put their name on something it will most likely sell so if you would you can't expect to make money but if you lose money from them it will either get back where it was or more because since they can release another phone and return to their recent share price.</p>
