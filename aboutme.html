      <h1>About Me and My Goal</h1>
      <p>I am a young male that wants to pursue entreprenuership. I ran into a problem of finding good and reliable information on a potential company to invest in. I had an idea to create a company that would solve the problem. I created a website of companies that needed investors and included pertinent information needed for the investor to make their decision. I want to make newer or older investors come to my website search the company they want to get informed about and get reliable and fast information. My website would help expedite the decision making process easier to make when your ready to invest. I would be the person to solve this because I love to invest and give tips to make others lives easier from my experience.</p>
